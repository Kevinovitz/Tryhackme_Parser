Changelog:

1.2

Fixed:
- When a login attempt didn't succeed it would continue parsing the resulting page. Now it checks whether the login attempt was successfull and tries again if it wasn't.
- Separated the login and parsing function in order to more easily verify the login attempt.

1.1

Added:
- Uses the Firefox driver instead of Chrome because reasons.
- The script now checks for a completed captcha challenge rather than waiting a set amount of time.
- The replaced task list variable couldn't be found if the first if statement didn't execute.

1.0

- Created the script.
