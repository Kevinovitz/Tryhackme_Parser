Changelog:

2.0

Fixed:
- The correct selectors have been added again...
- Updated to work with the Advent of Cyber 2024.

Added:
- Added some more context to some of the error messages.
- Added functionality to remove trailing pieces of text from the questions. This text is located in the submit/hint buttons on the page.
- Added a progress bar to the console output for fun.

1.9

Fixed:
- Changed the method of downloading the banner image to use request instead of urllib due to some coding warnings by semgrep.
- Also fixed an issue where the incorrect banner/cover image path was used when saving to a local folder instead of a Github repo.

1.8

Added:
- Found a different method of locating the correct elements which should be more robust and not change anymore.

1.7

Fixed:
- Fixed an error where the file wouldn't get written to a file if the file didn't already exist.
- Changed the selectors again...

1.6

Fixed:
- The correct selectors have been added again...

Added:
- Added functionality to check all relevant elements before parsing the webpage. This ensure no error is given on runtime due to missing elements or wrong selectors.                                                                   
- Added functionality to prompt before overwriting a file. This prevents a file on github to be altered.                                                

1.5

Fixed:
- Due to the new site layout, the element selectors changed. Apparently, they they have since changed again. I am not sure if this happens everytime or only after a set time.
- The correct selectors have been added.
- Time to wait before closing selenium instance has been increased to prevent an incomplete page from being parsed.                                        

Added:
- Added functionality of downloading the banner image when necessary instead of only changing the url to a file path.                                     

1.4

Added:
- Created variable to link to a github repo instead of hardcoding mine.        

1.3

Fixed:
- Typoe in a variable.

Added:
- It is now possible to save the file directly to your local github repo so you only need to sync changes.
- github_path variable can be used to set a path for the local copy of your github write-ups repo. If this is left blank, the file will instead be writen to the current working folder of the script.

1.2

Fixed:
- When a login attempt didn't succeed it would continue parsing the resulting page. Now it checks whether the login attempt was successfull and tries again if it wasn't.
- Separated the login and parsing function in order to more easily verify the login attempt.

1.1

Added:
- Uses the Firefox driver instead of Chrome because reasons.
- The script now checks for a completed captcha challenge rather than waiting a set amount of time.
- The replaced task list variable couldn't be found if the first if statement didn't execute.

1.0

- Created the script.
