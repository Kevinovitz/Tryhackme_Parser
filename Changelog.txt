Changelog:

1.3

Fixed:
- Typoe in a variable.

Added:
- It is now possible to save the file directly to your local github repo so you only need to sync changes.
- github_path variable can be used to set a path for the local copy of your github write-ups repo. If this is left blank, the file will instead be writen to the current working folder of the script.

1.2

Fixed:
- When a login attempt didn't succeed it would continue parsing the resulting page. Now it checks whether the login attempt was successfull and tries again if it wasn't.
- Separated the login and parsing function in order to more easily verify the login attempt.

1.1

Added:
- Uses the Firefox driver instead of Chrome because reasons.
- The script now checks for a completed captcha challenge rather than waiting a set amount of time.
- The replaced task list variable couldn't be found if the first if statement didn't execute.

1.0
