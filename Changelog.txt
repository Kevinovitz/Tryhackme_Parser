Changelog:

3.4

Fixed:

- Changed task element identifier from 3.3 to the correct one. 
- Fixed and issues where tasks with questions that didn't require an answer were completely filtered out.

Added:
- Added another keyword to filter out of the question text. Changed the task

3.3

Fixed:
- Modified the task element identifier as it would mistakenly include an unrelated element.

3.2

Fixed:
- Added some error handling and combined changed identifiers.

3.1

Fixed:
- Small modifications made to correctly identify relevant sections, tasks, and questions. Identifiers had changed.

3.0

Fixed:

- Big update due to a significant backend change of the website. Each task is now only loaded when the task has been expanded. It will unload once the task has been collapsed again. This requires interaction with the webpage before the necessary source data can be captured. Each task needs to be expanded and the loaded task data exported seperately.

Added:

- Added progress bar for the loading and saving of each task.
- Added function to handle the new process. This doesn't change the original workflow. New function can be removed to restore the original functionality

2.0

Fixed:
- The correct selectors have been added again...
- Updated to work with the Advent of Cyber 2024.

Added:
- Added some more context to some of the error messages.
- Added functionality to remove trailing pieces of text from the questions. This text is located in the submit/hint buttons on the page.
- Added a progress bar to the console output for fun.

1.9

Fixed:
- Changed the method of downloading the banner image to use request instead of urllib due to some coding warnings by semgrep.
- Also fixed an issue where the incorrect banner/cover image path was used when saving to a local folder instead of a Github repo.

1.8

Added:
- Found a different method of locating the correct elements which should be more robust and not change anymore.

1.7

Fixed:
- Fixed an error where the file wouldn't get written to a file if the file didn't already exist.
- Changed the selectors again...

1.6

Fixed:
- The correct selectors have been added again...

Added:
- Added functionality to check all relevant elements before parsing the webpage. This ensure no error is given on runtime due to missing elements or wrong selectors.                                                                   
- Added functionality to prompt before overwriting a file. This prevents a file on github to be altered.                                                

1.5

Fixed:
- Due to the new site layout, the element selectors changed. Apparently, they they have since changed again. I am not sure if this happens everytime or only after a set time.
- The correct selectors have been added.
- Time to wait before closing selenium instance has been increased to prevent an incomplete page from being parsed.                                        

Added:
- Added functionality of downloading the banner image when necessary instead of only changing the url to a file path.                                     

1.4

Added:
- Created variable to link to a github repo instead of hardcoding mine.        

1.3

Fixed:
- Typoe in a variable.

Added:
- It is now possible to save the file directly to your local github repo so you only need to sync changes.
- github_path variable can be used to set a path for the local copy of your github write-ups repo. If this is left blank, the file will instead be writen to the current working folder of the script.

1.2

Fixed:
- When a login attempt didn't succeed it would continue parsing the resulting page. Now it checks whether the login attempt was successfull and tries again if it wasn't.
- Separated the login and parsing function in order to more easily verify the login attempt.

1.1

Added:
- Uses the Firefox driver instead of Chrome because reasons.
- The script now checks for a completed captcha challenge rather than waiting a set amount of time.
- The replaced task list variable couldn't be found if the first if statement didn't execute.

1.0

- Created the script.
